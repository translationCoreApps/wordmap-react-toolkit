# Playground

This is a sandbox to try out wordMAP on some real input.
We've pre-populated some sentences to run predictions against.

**Alignment Memory**

Throughout the translation process it becomes apparent that certain phrases always translate the same.
This is most obvious for names, but can also include more complex phrases.

**Corpus**

Providing a portion of text and it's equivalent translation to wordMAP allows
for the statistical prediction of further alignments.

Here are some directions:

* Adding more alignment memory will improve the predictions.
* You can remove memory by clicking the `x` icon.
* Edit the corpus text and click the `save` button to use it in the predictions.
* Edit the sentences and the predictions will be rebuilt on the fly.

Try it out!
