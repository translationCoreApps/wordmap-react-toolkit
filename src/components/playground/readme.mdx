# Playground

This is a sandbox to try out wordMAP on some real input.
We've pre-populated some sentences to run predictions against.

Here are some directions:

* Adding more alignment memory will improve the predictions.
* You can remove memory by clicking the `x` icon.
* Edit the sentences and the predictions will be rebuilt on the fly.

Try it out!
