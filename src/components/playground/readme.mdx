# Playground

This is a sandbox to try out wordMAP on some real input.
We've pre-populated some sentences to run predictions against.

Here are some directions:

* Adding more alignment memory will improve the predictions.
* You can remove memory by clicking the `x` icon.
* Edit the corpus text and click the `save` button to use it in the predictions.
* Edit the sentences and the predictions will be rebuilt on the fly.

> Note: The predictions in these playgrounds may be less accurate than in practice, because no lemma information is provided in this playground.

## Alignment Memory Example

Throughout the translation process it becomes apparent that certain phrases always translate the same.
This is most obvious for names, but can also include more complex phrases.

<Playground>
    <WordmapPlayground
      sourceText="περὶ δὲ τῶν νεκρῶν, ὅτι ἐγείρονται, οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου, πῶς εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς λέγων, ἐγὼ ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ?"
      targetText="But concerning the dead that are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?"
      memory={[['Θεὸς', 'the God']]}
    />
</Playground>

## Corpus Example

Providing a portion of text and it's equivalent translation to wordMAP allows
for the statistical prediction of further alignments.

> DISCLAIMER: Generating suggestions based on corpus is still a work in progress.
