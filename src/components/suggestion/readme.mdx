<Props of={Suggestion}/>

## Basic usage

Suggest an alignment between `Guten Tag Ihnen` and `Good day to you`. 

<Playground>
    <SuggestionProvider source="Guten Tag Ihnen"
                        target="Good day to you">
        <Suggestion/>
    </SuggestionProvider>
</Playground>

## RTL Support

Suggestions can be oriented based on the text direction. 

> NOTE: For controlling the target text direction see **Alignment**.

<Playground>
    <SuggestionProvider source="Guten Tag Ihnen"
                        target="Good day to you">
        <Suggestion sourceDirection="rtl"/>
    </SuggestionProvider>
</Playground>
